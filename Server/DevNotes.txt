Concepts
- The world is the object foundery
-- It is the first point for the following
--- Request for objects to be loaded (World will create, but objects will self populate based in ID)
--- Objects should self load, but creation is handle v
--- Creating a new Object
--- Adding to the world and sub parts
--- Removeral from the world and sub parts

- Actions will do most of the heave lifting
-- Map and block will have simple add/remove commands
-- The rest is up to actions to handle
